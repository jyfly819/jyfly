[9.22] I bought a Respberry Pi 4B/2G online.  
[9.23-9.24] I learned some basic modules about Python including lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries; and did some basic exercises on Jupyter Notebook.
[9.25-9.27] After I got the Respberry Pi, I assembled Respberry Pi with its shield and burned system to a SD card. I also learned about how to configure language and Wi-Fi, and transfer documents to Respberry Pi.
