  This week, I didn't put too much attention on Raspberry Pi. This is mainly because I was preparing for
the Machine Learning quize.I'm going to focus on raspberry pi after the quize is done.Next week,I plan to
study pygame and try to program a simple game like snake or just a text adventure game on Raepberry pi.
